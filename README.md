# File_Sorter
This program sorts the files within a folder thet you chose into different categories, each category has associated file extensions.

<ul>
  <li>Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .tif and .tiff</li>
  <li>Video: .mp4, .avi, .mpg, .mpeg, .wmv, .mov and ogv</li>
  <li>Music: .mp3, .cda, .ogg and .wav</li>
  <li>Documents: .pdf, .doc, .odt, .docx, .odp, .ppt, ods, xls and xlsx</li>
  <li>Compressed files: .zip, .rar, .gz, .gzip, .tar and .tgz</li>
</ul>

All files that have different extencion than before will be send to an "Other" folder

You can modify the extentions in each category, add and delete. You can also change the name of the category.

The program has a function to add a new category but this function does not work because the menu is broken and no matter the option you choose it always gives the same value.
